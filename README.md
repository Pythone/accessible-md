## new header tags for the standard
We have tried to make new header tags so this could help
> accessibility-standard: accessible-md
> 
> methods-allowed: Screen-reader, Keyboard, Mouse, text-mode, Common, pic-only

First, accessibility-standard says the accessibility standard the Document is using
Second, methods-allowed displays what methods could use the document
- Screen-reader  is for screen-reader software
- Keyboard is for keyboard-only
- Mouse is for Mouse-only
- text-mode is for text-mode browsers
- pic-only means pic-only rendering
- Common means mouse, keyboard, and graphics
- more will be added

## File extension
The file extension will be .accessmd
